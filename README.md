CS 6290 Project 2
================
Tomasulo Algorithm
------------------------------------
### Sam Britt

####To build:

 - Run `make` to build optimized executables in the project root.
 - Run `make debug` to build non-optimized executables with debugging
   symbols in the project root.
 - Run `make clean` to remove all compiled files and generated
   dependency files.

####SYNOPSIS:

    tomalulo_sim [-v] <fetch-rate> <k0> <k1> <k2> <cdb-count> <trace_file>
    tomalulo_sim [-v] [-n <fetch-rate>] [--k0=<count>] [--k1=<count>] [--k2=<count>] [-c <count>] <trace_file>
    tomalulo_sim --help

####DESCRIPTION:
  The program can be run in one of two forms. In the first form, all
  simulation parameters are specified as position arguments. Their
  meaning is the same as the corresponding option described below.
  In the second form, the parameters are provided as named optional
  arguments. There is no in-between: either all arguments have to be
  positional, or none of them can be. If the positional form is used,
  any additional optional arguments will be overridden.

  In either form, `<trace_file>` is the final positional argument. It
  must be the path to a space-delimited file where each line contains
  instruction address (in hex), the functional unit type (0, 1, or
  2), the destination register, and the first and second source
  registers. If any register is not used, it should be specified as
  -1. For example,

        ab120024 0  1 2 3
        ab120028 1  4 1 3
        ab12002c 2 -1 4 7

####OPTIONS:
  The following options are available:

  - `-h`, `--help`

      Print help message and exit.

  - `-v`, `--verbose`

      Verbose mode: print the progress of the simulation; e.g. print
      notifications when an instruction is fetched, dispatched, etc.

  - `-m <value>`, `--max-cycles=<value>`

      Limit the number of cycles of the simulation to at most <value>.
      This is useful in debugging to prevent infinite loops.

  - `-n <value>`, `--fetch-rate=<value>`

      Set the fetch rate for the simulation; i.e., the number of
      instructions fetched per cycle. Defaults to 1.

  - `--k0=<value>`

    `--k1=<value>`

    `--k2=<value>`

      Set the number of functional units for functional unit type 0,
      1, or 2. Defaults to 1.

  - `-c <value>`, `--cdb=<value>`

      Set the number of common data busses for the simulation.
      Defaults to 1.
